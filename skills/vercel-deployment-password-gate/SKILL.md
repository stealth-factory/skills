# Vercel deployment password gate

A free, portable password wall for **preview deployments by default** — and for
**production too, opt-in** (see "Gating production too"). Humans see a brandable
unlock form once (a signed 1-year cookie keeps them in); automation passes with
named bypass tokens via header or query parameter. In the default preview-only
posture, production ships **no middleware function at all** (Mode B) or a
one-boolean short-circuit (Mode A), so the gate's production cost is zero. Only
a **scrypt hash** of the password is stored; unlock cookies are keyed
per-credential, so rotating the password or removing a bypass token revokes
exactly the cookies it issued.

## Removing an existing installation?

For "remove the password protection", "uninstall the gate", or "make the site
public again", go directly to [Remove the gate](./reference/uninstall.md).
Do not run the installation steps. That guide covers reverting isolated commits,
manual removal, external configuration cleanup, and deployment verification.

## What this reimplements

A free, DIY reimplementation of Vercel's **Advanced Deployment Protection**
add-on — **$150/mo on Pro** (30-day minimum before you can cancel), included on
Enterprise, and apparently **not sold on Hobby at all** — rebuilt in one
middleware file. Vercel bundles three features into the add-on — **all three are
supported here**:

| Advanced Deployment Protection | This skill |
| --- | --- |
| **Password Protection** | ✅ Unlock form + `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` (scrypt), mirroring the platform's semantics: enter once per deployment URL, and changing the password invalidates the cookies it issued. One difference: Vercel's change takes effect on existing deployments immediately; ours applies to new builds, so redeploy to revoke now. |
| **Private Production Deployments** (password on the production domain too) | ✅ Opt-in — previews by default, production via "Gating production too". Trade-off: the middleware then runs in prod, so the zero-prod-cost property is gone. |
| **Deployment Protection Exceptions** (unprotect specific **preview domains**) | ✅ `DEPLOY_GATE_UNPROTECTED_HOSTS` — comma-separated hosts that skip the gate and are public. Same axis as Vercel's (the *domain*); the `matcher` is a different thing (path-level: `/api`, static assets). See "Unprotect specific domains". |

Plus an equivalent of **Protection Bypass for Automation**: named, individually
revocable tokens, same header / query-param / set-cookie UX. This is **parity,
not an improvement** — Vercel's own bypass also supports multiple named,
individually revocable secrets ("You can create multiple bypass secrets per
project", docs updated 2026-04-30), and theirs additionally clears Firewall and
bot-protection challenges, which a DIY token cannot. The reason to use ours is
that it works *with* our gate; if you're on platform protection, use theirs.

Not reimplemented: **Shareable Links** (a per-recipient bypass token is the
closest analogue — no TTL), **Trusted IPs**/**Passport** (out of scope), and
**Vercel Authentication**, which *can't* be — that session lives on vercel.com.

**Two things $150/mo can't buy you.** The unlock page is *yours* — Vercel's
password screen is Vercel-branded with no *documented* theming hook (its whole
config surface across dashboard, API, and Terraform is `deploymentType` +
`password`), so matching a client's brand, logo, and design system is only
possible DIY. And on **Hobby**, where the docs indicate the add-on isn't sold,
this is very likely the only password option at all.

**What the platform does better:** it runs *before* your code (protects static
assets and every route, nothing to misconfigure), it can't fail open on a
missing env var, and it's Vercel's problem to maintain. This gate is a **speed
bump**, not auth — see the gotcha of the same name.

Release-method agnostic: everything keys off the Vercel environment
(`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`), never branch names — it composes with any
promotion/branch/deploy model.

## Step 0 — check whether you need this at all

| Need | Right tool |
| --- | --- |
| Only the Vercel team views previews | **Vercel Authentication** (Deployment Protection → Standard). Free on all plans, zero code, team members pass invisibly via their Vercel login. Prefer this when it fits. |
| External stakeholders | Vercel Authentication + **Shareable Links** (all plans; Hobby is capped at one link per account, Pro+ lifts the cap). Still zero code. |
| Anyone-with-a-password, for free | **This skill.** Vercel's **Password Protection** is Enterprise-only, or **Pro + $150/mo** for the *Advanced Deployment Protection* add-on (which you must keep ≥30 days before you can cancel) — both verified against Vercel's docs 2026-07-17; re-check pricing. On **Hobby it appears unbuyable** (the docs list it as "Enterprise, or a paid add-on for Pro", and say Hobby gets only Vercel Authentication) — *inferred from the plan listings, not stated outright*, so the DIY gate is very likely the only password option there. |
| The password page must carry **your/your client's branding** | **This skill.** Vercel's password screen is Vercel's — `deploymentType` + `password` is its whole documented config surface, with no theming hook. This gate renders your own HTML. |
| Non-Next framework, static export, or SPA on Vercel | **Still this skill** — use the framework-agnostic template via Vercel Routing Middleware (see "Pick your template"), which runs platform-level before the app or static assets. |

A DIY gate **cannot** detect "is this visitor logged into Vercel" — that session
lives on vercel.com and is only checkable by platform-level Vercel Authentication,
which runs *before* your code. Don't try to hybridize; pick per the table.

### Already on Vercel Authentication, need limited third-party access?

The DIY gate can't help here (the platform wall blocks third parties before your
code runs). Use the platform's own bypass methods instead:

1. **Shareable Links** — the purpose-built answer. Minted per deployment
   URL/alias with optional TTL, individually revocable, no shared secret. Create
   from the deployment's **Share** dialog in the dashboard, or via API
   (`PATCH /aliases/{id}/protection-bypass`, `ttl`). Available on **Hobby too**,
   but capped at *one link per account* there; Pro+ lifts the cap (verified
   2026-07-17).
2. **Protection Bypass for Automation** — secrets in a crafted URL:
   `https://<preview-url>/?x-vercel-protection-bypass=<secret>&x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie=true`
   persists a bypass cookie. You can create **multiple named secrets per
   project**, each revocable independently (docs updated 2026-04-30), and they
   also clear Firewall/bot-protection challenges. Caveat: secrets in URLs end up
   in logs, so prefer the header where the caller supports it.

## Pick your template

Two templates, identical behavior, env vars, and helper scripts — pick by framework:

| Project | Template | Installs as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Next.js** | [`templates/deploy-gate.ts`](./templates/deploy-gate.ts) — no deps beyond `next/server` + `node:crypto` | `proxy.ts` (Mode B) or `lib/deploy-gate.ts` (Mode A) |
| **Anything else on Vercel** (SvelteKit, Nuxt, Astro, Remix, static/SPA) | [`templates/deploy-gate.vercel.ts`](./templates/deploy-gate.vercel.ts) — uses Vercel Routing Middleware; one dep (`@vercel/functions`); `config.runtime` must stay `"nodejs"` (edge is the default and lacks `node:crypto`) | root `middleware.ts`, next to `package.json` |

The skill's mechanics (`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` gating, env-var management via
`vercel env`, build-time strip) are Vercel-platform-wide, not framework-specific.

## How the gate works (both modes)

Single self-contained file:

- Gates every **remote non-production** Vercel deployment — `preview` **and any
  custom environment** (e.g. a named "staging"). The signal is
  **`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`** (falling back to `VERCEL_ENV` when absent), NOT
  `VERCEL_ENV`: `VERCEL_ENV` only ever reports `production`/`preview`/`development`
  and collapses every custom environment into one of those buckets, so a custom
  target can read `VERCEL_ENV=production` and slip through **ungated**.
  `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` carries the custom name. It **fails open** when that value
  is `production` or `development`; when it's **unset**, it fails open only for a
  genuine local dev server (`NODE_ENV === "development"`) **or** when nothing is
  configured — a Vercel deploy with System Env Vars disabled also reads unset but
  runs `NODE_ENV=production`, so a configured one there still gates (see the
  Mode B lifecycle note).
- No valid cookie → responds `401` with an inline HTML password form (no extra
  routes/pages added to the app). Form POSTs to `/__deploy-unlock`.
- **Human auth:** `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` stores `s2:<salt>:<scryptHex>` (scrypt, memory-hard)
  — **never the plaintext**. Submitted passwords are run through scrypt and compared
  constant-time. (Legacy fallback: a plaintext `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD` also works.)
- **Automation auth (mimics Vercel's Protection Bypass for Automation):**
  `DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS` stores JSON `{"<label>":"<token>", ...}` —
  plaintext **by design** (automation must read tokens back; they're generated
  random, never human-reused). Send a token via the `x-deploy-gate-bypass`
  **header** (passes through + sets the cookie) or **query parameter** (303
  redirect to the cleaned URL — token stripped from the address bar — with the
  cookie set, so one crafted link = click-once access for a service that can't
  set headers). Bypass accepts **tokens only** — the human password never
  works in the header or query param: verifying a password costs a memory-hard
  scrypt run, so accepting it per-request would hand attackers a CPU-DoS
  amplifier (and passwords don't belong in URLs). The password unlocks solely
  via the form.
- Unlock cookies are HMACs **keyed on the credential that minted them**:
  rotating the password kills password-issued cookies; removing a bypass token
  kills that token's cookies. `maxAge` 1 year → "unlocks once, stays unlocked".
- **Absent config fails open** (a fresh clone never bricks its previews);
  **present-but-malformed `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` fails CLOSED** (503) — a
  typo must not silently publish a preview the operator meant to protect. A
  legacy `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD` longer than the 256-char cap also fails closed
  (it would hash into a config the unlock form's length cap can never match —
  gated with no way in), and the 503 body names both causes. Malformed
  bypass-token JSON is ignored with a warning (password still works).

**Why a cookie, not localStorage:** the decision happens server-side in the
proxy before any JavaScript runs; the token must travel with the request.
localStorage physically cannot gate SSR. Same "enter once" UX.

### Env-var names (and the legacy aliases)

All config vars use the **`DEPLOY_GATE_`** prefix, because the gate protects
production too — the old `PREVIEW_`-prefixed names implied preview-only and were
misleading once production gating landed:

| Purpose | Current name | Legacy alias (still honoured) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Password hash | `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` | `PREVIEW_PASSWORD_HASH` |
| Plaintext password (legacy scheme) | `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD` | `PREVIEW_PASSWORD` |
| Automation bypass tokens | `DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS` | `PREVIEW_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS` |
| Unprotected-host allowlist | `DEPLOY_GATE_UNPROTECTED_HOSTS` | *(new — no alias)* |

The gate reads the current name first and **falls back to the legacy alias with
a one-time warning** if only the old one is set — a rename can't fail open,
because absent config is intentionally fail-open (an existing install that still
has `PREVIEW_PASSWORD_HASH` keeps working; migrate at leisure). The current name
**wins** if both are set. To migrate, add the `DEPLOY_GATE_*` var and remove the
`PREVIEW_*` one; the alias support is a courtesy, not a permanent contract.

## Before installing — make the change reversible (required)

1. Inspect `git status --short` and the existing middleware/build configuration.
   Preserve unrelated work. Use a feature branch or isolated worktree; do not
   stage other changes into the gate installation.
2. **Implement and commit the gate as a standalone change.** Include its helper,
   integration, branded form, gate-only tests, build wiring, and any dependency
   and lockfile changes in a gate-only commit, e.g.
   `feat(deploy-gate): install deployment password protection`. Stage explicit
   paths or hunks and inspect `git diff --cached` before committing.
3. Keep independently useful prerequisites (such as a middleware-to-proxy
   migration) in separate commits. Keep subsequent gate fixes/customizations
   gate-only too. Do not mix application features into these commits.
   If the repository requires squash merges, use a **gate-only PR** so the
   resulting squash commit is also safe to revert.
4. Copy [the installation record](./templates/deploy-gate-installation.md) into
   the app, normally `docs/deploy-gate-installation.md`, and fill in actual paths,
   mode, build changes, dependency changes, variable **names and scopes**, and
   external configuration changes. Never record passwords, hashes, tokens, or
   bypass URLs. Include this initial record in the installation commit.
5. After committing, record the full installation SHA(s) in a separate docs
   commit (a commit cannot contain its own SHA). After a squash/rebase, update
   the record with the actual commits on the target branch; the PR URL helps
   locate them. Record prerequisites separately as **keep by default**. Include
   the uninstall guide link and these SHAs in the handoff. If commits are
   explicitly disallowed, keep the record and report that manual removal is
   required until an isolated installation commit exists.

A Git revert only undoes repository changes. Vercel variables, CI secrets,
platform settings, and existing deployments need separate cleanup; see
[Remove the gate](./reference/uninstall.md). Do not promise one-command uninstall.

## Mode A — app already has `middleware.ts` / `proxy.ts`

The middleware function already runs on every matched request, so the gate adds
one env-var boolean in production — no new invocations, no meaningful cost.

> ⚠️ **If the host file is legacy `middleware.ts`, migrate it to `proxy.ts`
> first** (`npx @next/codemod@canary middleware-to-proxy .` — the tag Next's proxy
docs use for this codemod, or rename the file
> + the exported function and fix test imports). `middleware.ts` runs on the
> **Edge runtime even in Next 16**, where `node:crypto` does not exist — the
> gate 500s every request. Caught in a real install (piaf-web, Next 16.2.7,
> 2026-07-17): `Error: Failed to load external module node:crypto`.

1. Copy [`templates/deploy-gate.ts`](./templates/deploy-gate.ts) **next to your
   host proxy file** and import it *relatively*. If the host proxy is at the
   project root (`proxy.ts`), put the helper at `lib/deploy-gate.ts`; if the
   host uses a `src/` layout (`src/proxy.ts`), put it at `src/lib/deploy-gate.ts`
   — a root `./lib/deploy-gate` import from `src/proxy.ts` resolves to
   `src/lib/…` and won't find a root `lib/`, so the build fails.
2. Wire it into the existing `proxy()` / `middleware()` function — check first,
   attach the cookie to whatever response the pipeline produces last. Pass the
   request protocol so the unlock cookie persists on a local `http://` dev run:

   ```ts
   import { previewGate, withUnlockCookie } from "./lib/deploy-gate";

   export async function proxy(request: NextRequest) {
     const gate = await previewGate(request);
     if (gate.block) return gate.block;

     // Strip the bypass token from the headers forwarded upstream, so your app /
     // request logging never sees it (Mode B's proxy.ts does this for you). Pass
     // THESE cleaned headers into your pipeline — don't reuse the raw `request`.
     const headers = new Headers(request.headers);
     headers.delete("x-deploy-gate-bypass");
     const cleaned = new NextRequest(request.nextUrl, {
       headers,
       method: request.method,
       body: request.body,
       duplex: "half", // required whenever a (stream) body is forwarded, else POSTs throw
     });

     const response = await yourExistingLogic(cleaned);
     const secure = request.nextUrl.protocol === "https:";
     return gate.setCookie ? withUnlockCookie(response, gate.setCookie, secure) : response;
   }
   ```

   (If your host logic doesn't take a request argument — it reads globals or
   `NextResponse.next()`s — set the cleaned headers on the continue-response
   instead: `NextResponse.next({ request: { headers } })`.)

   The `setCookie` path matters: a header-bypassed request must CONTINUE
   through the host pipeline (i18n redirects, rewrites, analytics cookies) —
   returning a bare pass-through from the gate would skip all of it (caught by
   review on the piaf-web install).

3. Check the host matcher: it must not exclude `/__deploy-unlock`, and if it
   excludes `/api` (piaf-web's did), decide deliberately — un-gated API routes
   on previews are usually a hole. Include `/api` in the matcher and skip only
   the host's page-routing logic for API paths.
4. Do **NOT** wire up the removal script — the host middleware must ship to
   production for its own duties.

## Mode B — app has NO middleware (strict zero prod cost)

The gate file is the app's real, checked-in `proxy.ts`; a build step strips it
from production builds only:

1. Copy [`templates/deploy-gate.ts`](./templates/deploy-gate.ts) to `proxy.ts`
   **at the same level as your `app`/`pages` directory** — the project root, or
   **`src/proxy.ts` if the app uses a `src/` directory**. ⚠️ Next only loads the
   proxy at that level: a root `proxy.ts` in a `src/`-layout app is **silently
   ignored**, and every preview then deploys **ungated even with the password
   set** — the worst failure mode, because nothing errors. (It's checked in — it
   IS the middleware; lintable, typecheckable.) **If the app customises
   `pageExtensions`** (e.g. `.page.ts`), Next expects the proxy named to match —
   `proxy.page.ts` — per Next's proxy docs; a plain `proxy.ts` is ignored (same
   silent-ungate). Name the file accordingly and point the removal script's
   `CANDIDATES` at it.
2. Copy [`templates/remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs`](./templates/remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs)
   to `scripts/remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs`. It scans the common install paths
   (`proxy.ts`, `src/proxy.ts`, `middleware.ts`, `src/middleware.ts`) for the
   managed marker, so a `src/` layout needs no edit; if the gate lives somewhere
   else, add that path to its `CANDIDATES` array.
3. Chain it into the build (explicit chaining, **not** an npm `prebuild` hook —
   pnpm skips pre/post scripts by default):

   ```jsonc
   // package.json
   "build": "node scripts/remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs && next build"
   ```
4. **Verify after the first preview deploy** — this catches the silent-ungate
   class above in one command:

   ```bash
   curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://<your-preview-url>/
   # expect 401 (gated). 200 means the proxy isn't running — check its location.
   ```

Non-Next frameworks: same steps, but the checked-in file is `middleware.ts`
**at the project root only** (next to `package.json`) from the framework-agnostic
template. Unlike Next's `proxy.ts`, Vercel Routing Middleware is **only** loaded
from the repo root — a `src/middleware.ts` copy is silently ignored and the
preview deploys ungated, so do NOT put it under `src/` even in a src-layout app
(the `src/*` guidance above is Next-only). The removal script still scans the
`src/` paths defensively, but don't rely on that. Chain the script before the
framework's own build command.

Lifecycle:

| Context | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Local `next dev` / a Vite dev server (`NODE_ENV=development`), `vercel dev` (`VERCEL_ENV=development`), non-Vercel hosts | Gate no-ops — a dev server is detected by `NODE_ENV=development` (or a `development` Vercel target), so it stays ungated **even if you've pulled preview creds into `.env.local`**. Test the gate locally by forcing a preview target: `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV=preview DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD=test next dev`. |
| Vercel **preview** OR any **custom environment** (e.g. `staging`) build | File ships, gate active (keyed on `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`). The build-strip only fires on true `production` (`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`), so custom-env builds keep the proxy. |
| Vercel **production** build | Script deletes the gate file before `next build` → the deployment provisions **no middleware function** → zero invocations, zero cost, structurally. |

> **How local vs. preview is told apart (and why the System-Env toggle matters).**
> The gate passes on a `production`/`development` Vercel target, and on a local
> dev server — detected by `NODE_ENV === "development"` (which `next dev` and
> Vite set, and which a Vercel deployment never has at runtime). It gates every
> remote target otherwise. The one ambiguous case is a Vercel **preview with
> "System Environment Variables" disabled** (Vercel → Settings → Environment
> Variables — normally on): with the toggle off, no `VERCEL_*` var reaches the
> runtime, so the target reads `undefined` — but `NODE_ENV` is `production`
> there (it isn't one of the toggle-gated `VERCEL_*` vars), so the gate can tell
> it apart from local dev and **still gates it**. It fails safe either way. Two
> costs of leaving the toggle off: (1) the build-strip needs `VERCEL=1`, so it
> goes inert and production ships the (no-op) middleware — you lose the zero-cost
> property; and (2) **`DEPLOY_GATE_UNPROTECTED_HOSTS` stops working** — host
> exceptions are only honored when the target is a known Vercel env (Host is
> spoofable otherwise), so with the toggle off a domain you marked public stays
> gated. **Recommend enabling it** — required if you use host exceptions.

Safety guards in the removal script: it only deletes a file carrying the
`@deploy-gate:managed` marker (never hand-written middleware — if no marked file
is found it **warns loudly** and leaves everything, since a silent skip would
read as "stripped OK"), and it only acts inside a real Vercel TRUE-production
build (`VERCEL=1` plus `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` — falling back to `VERCEL_ENV` —
equal to `production`), so local builds never mutate the working tree and
custom-environment builds keep the gate. The file is git-tracked anyway;
`git checkout -- proxy.ts` restores it if anything ever goes sideways.

## Gating production too (deliberate deviation)

By default this gate is **preview-only** — production always passes through, and
in Mode B the proxy is stripped from production builds entirely. Sometimes a user
genuinely wants a password wall on production: a **pre-launch "coming soon"
site**, a **client demo on the real domain**, or a **private internal tool**.
This skill can do that, but treat it as a fork, not a toggle — and start by
asking *why*, because the answer decides whether this is even the right tool.

**First, the guardrail — is this the right tool?** This gate is a *shared-password
speed bump*: one password, no per-user identity, no rate limiting (see the
"speed bump, not auth" gotcha). It is fine for a teaser page, a demo, or a
low-stakes internal tool. It is **NOT** access control for real user data,
accounts, payments, or anything you'd be embarrassed to see breached — for that,
steer the user to **Vercel Authentication**, **Clerk**, or a real IdP instead.
If they insist on this for a high-stakes surface, say plainly that it's a speed
bump, not a lock.

**If it's a legitimate low-stakes case, make these three changes together:**

1. **Predicate — also gate production.** In `previewGate`, drop the
   `production` arm from the pass-through condition, but **keep the stock
   local-dev guard exactly** — do NOT pass on a bare `target === undefined`.
   A real Vercel deployment with System Environment Variables disabled also
   reports `undefined`, so passing on it would leave your production site
   public. Only a genuine local dev server (`NODE_ENV === "development"`) or a
   fully-unconfigured deployment should fall through:

   ```ts
   const target = process.env.VERCEL_TARGET_ENV ?? process.env.VERCEL_ENV;
   // gate production too — pass ONLY for the local dev server; `undefined`
   // alone is NOT safe (a System-Env-disabled Vercel deploy reads undefined).
   if (target === "development") return {}; // or { action: "pass" }
   if (target === undefined && process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") return {};
   // …then fall through to the stock config/credentials checks, which fail open
   // only when nothing is configured.
   ```

2. **Mode B ONLY — do NOT wire `remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs`.** ⚠️ This is the
   footgun. That script *deletes the gate from production builds* (the whole
   zero-cost trick). If you gate production but leave the removal script in the
   build chain, the proxy vanishes in prod and **the site is wide open with no
   warning**. Remove the `node scripts/remove-proxy-on-prod.mjs &&` from the
   build command. (Mode A has no removal script, so nothing to undo there.)

3. **Env vars — add the Production scope.** The password hash and any bypass
   tokens are Preview-scoped by default; add them to **Production** too, e.g.
   `… | vercel env add DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH production`. Without this the
   production gate has no configured password and **fails open** (absent config
   is intentionally fail-open so a fresh clone isn't bricked).

**Consequence to state to the user:** the "zero production cost" property is
gone — the middleware now runs on every production request (one env check +,
when locked, the response). That's the price of gating production; it's small,
but it's no longer free.

## Style the unlock page (required when installing)

The form in `unlockFormHtml()` is a deliberately neutral baseline. Styling it is
**the payoff for doing this yourself** — Vercel's paid Password Protection shows
Vercel's own screen with no documented theming hook, so a branded wall is
something the add-on cannot buy. It's also often the first thing a client or stakeholder sees.

When installing the gate into a real project, **restyle it professionally to match
the project's existing look and feel** — check for a design system, brand
tokens, fonts, logo, and how existing auth/error pages are styled, and mirror
them. If the project has no design language, keep it minimal and clean rather
than inventing one. Requirements:

- **Responsive and mobile-first**: fluid layout (no fixed widths), works from
  ~320px up, `min-height: 100dvh` centering, comfortable touch targets
  (≥44px), and ≥16px input font-size (prevents iOS auto-zoom on focus).
- **Self-contained or same-origin only**: inline all CSS; a logo may be inlined
  as a data URI or referenced same-origin (the matcher lets static assets
  through) — never load from external hosts.
- Support light AND dark (`color-scheme` + `prefers-color-scheme`).
- **Preserve the functional invariants**: `method="post"`, the computed
  `action` (UNLOCK_PATH + encoded `from`), `name="password"`, the failed-state
  error message, `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`, `autofocus`,
  `autocomplete="current-password"`, and `escapeHtml()` on anything
  interpolated. Style everything else freely.

## Set or rotate the password (agent workflow)

Same flow for first-time setup and rotation — only the hash is ever stored:

1. **Get the plaintext from the user** (ask directly, or offer to generate one:
   `openssl rand -base64 12`, show it to the user ONCE). Never write the
   plaintext to any file, env file, commit, or log — **shell history counts**,
   which is why the commands below never put it on a command line.
2. **Hash it** with the bundled script (matches the gate's scheme, random salt
   each run). Run it with **no argument** so it prompts on stdin:

   ```bash
   node <skill-dir>/templates/hash-password.mjs
   # Deploy-gate password: ‹typed, not echoed to history›
   # → s2:<salt>:<scryptHex>
   ```

   The script also accepts `hash-password.mjs '<plaintext>'`, but that lands the
   password in shell history and in `ps` output — use it only for a throwaway
   local test, never for a real password.

3. **Store the hash, scoped to Preview only.** Only the hash leaves the machine:

   ```bash
   # first setup:
   node <skill-dir>/templates/hash-password.mjs | vercel env add DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH preview
   # rotation — in-place, no gap:
   node <skill-dir>/templates/hash-password.mjs | vercel env update DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH preview
   ```

   Use `vercel env update` to rotate, **not** `rm` then `add`: between an `rm`
   and the next build the var is absent, and absent config **fails open** — a
   deployment built in that window ships ungated. The prompt writes to stderr
   and the hash to stdout, so the pipe carries only the hash. Pasting the `s2:…`
   string into the Vercel dashboard is equivalent — the CLI is convenience, not
   a requirement. (The hash is fine stored **sensitive**, Vercel's default —
   rotation mints a fresh hash and never needs to read the old one back.)

   Project uses **custom environments** (e.g. `staging`)? Repeat for each one
   (`… | vercel env add DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH staging`) — custom environments
   have their own env-var scope on Vercel and do NOT inherit Preview vars, yet
   the gate DOES activate there; leave the var unset and that environment has
   absent config → **fails open, silently ungated**.

4. **Tell the user the rotation semantics:**
   - New deployments use the new hash immediately; all previously issued
     password cookies stop working on them (cookie is keyed on the hash).
   - **Already-deployed previews keep honoring the old password until each is
     redeployed** — Vercel env changes apply to new builds only. Redeploy the
     stable staging alias if immediate revocation matters.
   - **The stored hash is itself a bearer secret — treat a leak like a leaked
     password.** The unlock cookie is `HMAC(key = the hash, "deploy-gate:unlocked:v1")`,
     a fixed public message, so anyone who obtains `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH`
     (a copied dashboard value, a CI log) can forge a valid cookie **without**
     ever recovering the plaintext — scrypt's memory-hardness only protects the
     *plaintext*, not access. So keep the hash out of logs, and **rotate it** on
     any suspected disclosure, not just a plaintext leak. (Fine for a speed bump;
     just don't reuse a real password, and don't treat the hash as safe to
     expose.)

## Manage automation bypass tokens (agent workflow)

Named, individually revocable machine credentials, stored as JSON in
`DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS` (Preview scope — plus each custom environment,
which has its own env-var scope; same caveat as the password hash). Use
[`templates/bypass-tokens.mjs`](./templates/bypass-tokens.mjs) — it's pure
(JSON in → JSON out on stdout, human summary + generated token on stderr), the
agent glues it to `vercel env`:

> ⚠️ **Store this var `--no-sensitive` — the workflow depends on reading it
> back.** `vercel env add` defaults to **sensitive** for Preview (and the
> "make it sensitive?" prompt is *skipped* when the value arrives via a pipe, as
> it does here — so the default applies silently), and sensitive values **can't
> be pulled or listed afterward**. Add/remove edits the *existing* token map, so
> a map stored sensitive is unrecoverable: the next edit rebuilds from `{}` and
> **revokes every other token**. Always pass `--no-sensitive` (the tokens are
> plaintext by design anyway). If a team policy *enforces* sensitive, keep the
> token map's source of truth outside Vercel (a secrets manager), or accept
> rotate-all semantics. A map already stored sensitive can't be salvaged —
> regenerate all tokens from `{}` and re-point the automation.

1. **Read the current value** (skip on first setup):

   ```bash
   vercel env pull --environment=preview /tmp/dg.env
   grep '^DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS=' /tmp/dg.env   # KEY="json" — strip the quotes to get raw JSON
   rm /tmp/dg.env                                    # don't leave it around
   ```

2. **Edit, capturing the new map in ONE run** (label examples: `ci`,
   `lighthouse`, `uptime`). Run the helper exactly once and keep its stdout —
   `add` mints a fresh random token *per invocation*, so running it twice stores
   a different token than the one you showed the user:

   ```bash
   NEW="$(node <skill-dir>/templates/bypass-tokens.mjs add ci '<current-json-or-empty>')"
   # or:  NEW="$(node <skill-dir>/templates/bypass-tokens.mjs remove lighthouse '<current-json>')"
   node <skill-dir>/templates/bypass-tokens.mjs list '<current-json>'   # read-only, no write-back
   ```

   `add` writes the new map to stdout and the generated token + summary to
   stderr; show that token to the user once. It refuses duplicate labels —
   rotate by `remove` + `add`.

3. **Write back the `$NEW` map you captured in step 2** — pipe that exact JSON,
   don't re-run the helper (a second `add` would mint a different token):

   ```bash
   # first setup:
   printf '%s' "$NEW" | vercel env add    DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS preview --no-sensitive
   # thereafter (in-place, no fail-open gap):
   printf '%s' "$NEW" | vercel env update DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS preview --no-sensitive
   ```

   `--no-sensitive` is required so step 1 can read the map back next time (see
   the warning above). `update` avoids the `rm`→`add` window where the var is
   absent and the gate fails open.

4. **Usage by automation** (tell the user):
   - Header (CI, Playwright, curl): `x-deploy-gate-bypass: <token>`
   - Query param (services that can't set headers; also human click-once
     links): `https://<preview-url>/path?x-deploy-gate-bypass=<token>` — the
     gate 303s to the cleaned URL and sets the cookie.
   - Mimic Vercel's `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET` convention: designate one
     token (e.g. `ci`) and store it as a CI secret named
     `DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_SECRET` for workflows to read.
5. **Revocation semantics:** removing a token invalidates its cookies on new
   deployments immediately (cookies are keyed per-token) — but as with the
   password, **already-deployed previews honor the old env until redeployed**.
   Removing the **last** token on a token-only deployment (no password hash)
   leaves the var as `{}`, which now **fails closed** (503) rather than
   publishing — to make such a deployment public, *unset* the var entirely
   (`vercel env rm DEPLOY_GATE_BYPASS_TOKENS preview --yes`), don't empty it.

## Unprotect specific domains (Deployment Protection Exceptions)

The equivalent of Vercel's **Deployment Protection Exceptions**: list hosts that
skip the gate entirely. Use it when one preview domain must be public — a
stable demo URL for a client, a webhook receiver, a domain an external service
crawls — while every other preview stays locked.

```bash
# comma-separated; exact hosts, not patterns. --no-sensitive so you can read
# the list back to append to it later (it isn't a secret — it's public hosts).
printf 'demo.acme.com, hooks-preview.acme.com' \
  | vercel env add DEPLOY_GATE_UNPROTECTED_HOSTS preview --no-sensitive
# to append later: pull + edit the list, then `vercel env update … --no-sensitive`
```

Semantics, matching Vercel's feature (and its dashboard's deliberate friction —
it makes you type "unprotect my domain" for a reason):

- **A listed host is fully public.** Not "password optional" — no wall at all.
  Anything reachable on that host is world-readable. Confirm the host with the
  user before adding it, and say plainly what goes public.
- **Exact host match**, case-insensitive, port-stripped. **Not** a suffix or
  wildcard match — listing `acme.com` does *not* unprotect `demo.acme.com`. This
  is deliberate: a suffix match would unprotect every subdomain from one typo.
  List each host explicitly.
- **Checked before the config check**, so an exception still holds if
  `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` is malformed — otherwise the fail-closed 503 would
  take down a domain the operator explicitly marked public.
- **Bare hostnames only** — `demo.acme.com`, not `https://demo.acme.com/` and
  not an IP literal. A malformed entry is **ignored with a warning** and that
  domain stays gated (check build/function logs if an exception seems inert).
- **Removing a host re-protects only NEW builds.** Vercel's dashboard version
  re-protects existing deployments immediately; this one is an env var, so every
  already-deployed preview on that host **stays public until redeployed** — same
  lag as password rotation. Redeploy if it matters.
- **Unset (the default) = nothing is excepted**, so existing installs are
  unaffected.
- **Vercel-only, and needs "System Environment Variables" ON.** The check trusts
  the `Host` header, which is safe here *because Vercel's edge routes on that same
  value* — you can't forge it into reaching a deployment you weren't routed to.
  That's a property of Vercel's routing, not of the attacker. So the gate honors
  exceptions **only when it can confirm it's on Vercel** (a known
  `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV`/`VERCEL_ENV`). With the **System-Env-Vars toggle off** those
  vars are absent, so exceptions are silently **not** honored and the host stays
  gated — enable the toggle if you use this var. Self-hosted or behind a proxy
  that routes on the absolute-form target or TLS SNI while forwarding the client's
  `Host`, `Host` is spoofable — don't use this var off Vercel.
- Scope it like the other vars: Preview, plus each custom environment.
- Vercel's version is preview-domains-only. This one keys off the request host,
  so if you've opted into gating production it will except a production host
  too — which is exactly the "public marketing page, gated app" split, but make
  sure that's what you meant.

## Gotchas

- **Static assets are public — matters for SPAs / static sites.** The `matcher`
  excludes real static-asset requests (`.js`, `.css`, images, fonts, source
  maps) so they never run the gate. For an **SSR app** that's fine — those are
  framework code. But a **static export or SPA often bakes its content or data
  into the hashed JS bundle**, and with the default matcher anyone who learns an
  asset URL can fetch that material **without the password** — the gate only
  protects the HTML shell. If your bundles carry anything sensitive, **gate
  everything**: set the matcher to `"/((?!favicon\\.ico$).*)"` (only the tab icon
  stays public) and inline the unlock page's logo as a data URI (a same-origin
  logo would otherwise be gated). It costs one cheap cookie-compare per asset
  request (scrypt runs only on the unlock POST), and in Mode B production still
  ships no middleware at all. This is the "speed bump, not auth" line in
  practice — decide per app.
- **Custom environments don't inherit Preview env vars.** The gate activates on
  custom environments (`VERCEL_TARGET_ENV=staging`), but `vercel env add …
  preview` doesn't reach them — each custom environment is its own scope. Add
  `DEPLOY_GATE_PASSWORD_HASH` (and any bypass tokens) per custom environment, or
  use "Import variables" when creating it; otherwise that environment sees
  absent config and fails open, silently ungated.
- **Cookies are per-origin.** The stable branch alias (`*-git-main-*.vercel.app`)
  unlocks once, permanently — but every PR's unique preview URL prompts once per
  browser. Expected behavior, warn stakeholders.
- **Upgrading from an older install re-prompts once.** The cookie name changed
  (`preview_gate` → `deploy_gate`) and the unlock HMAC context changed with it,
  so anyone currently unlocked will see the form one more time after you deploy
  this version. Harmless, one-time. (The bypass header also changed:
  `x-preview-gate-bypass` → `x-deploy-gate-bypass` — update any automation that
  sends it. The old header is not accepted.)
- **Query-param tokens can land in logs** (server/proxy access logs capture the
  first request even though the gate strips the URL afterward) — same caveat
  Vercel documents for its own bypass query param. Prefer the header where the
  caller supports it; treat leaked tokens as rotate-on-suspicion.
- **Next ≤15 / edge runtime:** Next 16's `proxy.ts` is Node-runtime-only, which
  is what the template assumes (`node:crypto`). On Next ≤15 rename the file to
  `middleware.ts`, the export to `middleware` (and the removal-script target to
  match); if it runs on the edge runtime, replace `node:crypto` with Web Crypto
  (`crypto.subtle.digest`/`sign` + a manual XOR-fold compare) — edge has no
  `node:crypto`.
- **This is a speed bump, not auth.** One shared password + machine tokens, no
  user identity, no rate limiting. Never use it as access control for real user
  data, accounts, or payments. Gating **production** is supported (see "Gating
  production too") but only for low-stakes surfaces — a coming-soon page, a
  client demo, an internal tool. If the thing behind the wall would be a breach,
  use Vercel Authentication, Clerk, or a real IdP. The expensive scrypt check runs only on
  explicit form POSTs to `/__deploy-unlock` (input capped at 256 chars);
  every per-request check — cookie, bypass tokens — is a cheap constant-time
  compare, so the gate itself is not a CPU amplifier.
- **`formData()` in the proxy** consumes the request body — fine here because a
  locked-out visitor's POST never reaches the app anyway.
- **Turbo/monorepo caches:** the removal script mutates the app dir before
  `next build`; make sure `VERCEL_TARGET_ENV` (and its `VERCEL_ENV` fallback)
  participates in the build's cache key — a custom-env build and a true-prod
  build can share `VERCEL_ENV=production` yet differ in whether the proxy
  ships. On Vercel this works via environment separation; for custom Turborepo
  remote caching, add both to the task's `env` list.

Provenance & changelog: how every non-obvious claim was verified, and the full version history, live in [`reference/changelog.md`](./reference/changelog.md). In brief — Vercel pricing/plan/behavior and Next.js proxy placement are verified against the official docs (2026-07-17); the gate's decision logic, env-var fallback, host-matching, and the removal script are smoke-tested with runnable harnesses; and the security-sensitive changes (scrypt hashing, tokens-only bypass, the two fail-open fixes) each trace to a specific review finding recorded there.
